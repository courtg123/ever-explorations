# Ever Explorations - Project Ideas

These are placeholder projects for future development. Each represents an exploration into different areas of technology and creativity.

## AI Projects

### AI Assistant Framework
**Category:** AI  
**Status:** Beta  
**Description:** Experimental framework for building contextual AI assistants. Playing with different approaches to maintain conversation context and generate more helpful responses.

### Pattern Recognition Engine
**Category:** AI  
**Status:** Beta  
**Description:** Machine learning experiments in pattern recognition. Currently exploring visual pattern detection in abstract datasets.

## Experimental Projects

### WebGL Particle System
**Category:** Experiment  
**Status:** Beta  
**Description:** Interactive particle system built with WebGL. Started as a "what if I made the particles react to music?" and evolved from there.

### Quantum State Visualizer
**Category:** Experiment  
**Status:** Beta  
**Description:** Attempting to visualize quantum computing concepts in an intuitive way. Still figuring out how to make qubits less abstract.

## Tool Projects

### Code Complexity Analyzer
**Category:** Tool  
**Status:** Beta  
**Description:** Tool for analyzing and visualizing code complexity in large codebases. Because sometimes you need to see just how tangled things have become.

## Coding Projects

### Distributed Task Runner
**Category:** Coding  
**Status:** Beta  
**Description:** Experimental distributed computing framework for running parallel tasks. Started when I wondered if I could use all my devices as one computer.

### Real-time Collaboration Engine
**Category:** Coding  
**Status:** Beta  
**Description:** WebRTC-based collaboration tools. Building the infrastructure for real-time code collaboration with conflict-free replicated data types.
